            <h2>Discovery Pass</h2>
            <div class="cat">
                <p>It is necessary to know that you must buy Discovery Pass that allows you to enter the national parks in Canada and enjoy all the beauty. So yes, all four major national parks - Banff, Jasper, Yoho and Kootenay are included in the Discovery Pass.</p>
                <p>Although it is possible to buy a day pass to some places in the Canadian Rockies, it makes more sense for international visitors (and we believe even for locals) to buy a pass that is valid for one year.</p>
                <p>The Discovery Pass is not exactly cheap, but you can visit all parks in the entire country.</p>
                <p>Once you buy the ticket, please keep it in the car behind the windshield, so the scanning process is fast, and you do not have to wait in the queue.</p>
                <p>Discovery Pass costs CAD 136.40 for a group of up to 7 people (in one car), which is, after all, not expensive when you consider you get access to such a unique area, and moreover, you can share the cost with others.</p>
                <p>Once you have the Discovery Pass, you can visit the best places in Canada's National Parks for free.</p>
                <p>It is possible to buy the pass at the park's gate or in visitor centers.</p>

        <div class="header" id="budget">
            <h2>Budget</h2>
            <div class="cat">
                <p>How much should you budget when planning your trip to the Canadian Rockies? It is quite hard to give you an exact answer because every traveler considers cheap, mid-range, or luxury travel differently.</p>
                <p>When we were traveling in South America, we soon understood that what some travelers thought was traveling on a low budget, was for us already a mid-range category.</p>
                <p>Simply put, every visitors travel differently and require a different level of comfort.</p>
                <p>Although Canada overall is not a cheap country for traveling, you can always find an option that will suit (or be at least close) your budget.</p>
                <p>For example, we rented a car, slept in campgrounds, and cooked our food.</p>
                <p>And, by doing it in that way, we saved a lot of money for traveling more. On the other hand, it required booking all services a long time in advance, and we had to lower our comfort level.</p>
                <p>Prices in the Rockies skyrocket, especially in the summer, and sometimes the rates can make your head spin, so our best advice is not to leave the planning part for the last moment; planning ahead of time and defining your requirements can be a huge game-changer.</p>
                <p>Still I want you to have some idea about prices in Canada:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 weeks car rental (Economy version, including car insurance) - 720 CAD</li>
                    <li>1 liter of gas - 1.28 CAD (just heads up, in generally cars in Canada are less economy than what we are used to in Europe)</li>
                    <li>Public bus from Calgary to Banff - 18 CAD vs. Shuttle bus from Calgary airport to Banff - 65 CAD</li>
                    <li>1 night at campground - 15 - 38 CAD per site (depends on location and facilities available)</li>
                    <li>1 night at hostel in Banff (high season) - 55 CAD (how crazy is that??)</li>
                    <li>1 night at 3* hotel in Banff - 200 CAD+ per room (2ppl)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>    
        </div>
        <div class="header" id="pack">
            <h2>What to Pack</h2>
            <div class="cat">
                <p>Once you decide in what season you'll be traveling, you can start packing. But the truth is that as the weather in the Canadian Rockies changes a lot, the packing list does not differ that much for summer and winter as you still need many layers to keep yourself comfortable and warm.</p>
                <p>Items you want to pack also depend on activities you plan on doing. If your idea of a road trip is that you'll be mainly driving and from time to time get off to take a picture, you can travel with a suitcase, jeans, and down jacket.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, if you want to spend your time more actively, you need proper outdoor equipment as it does not pay off to underestimate Canadian weather conditions.</p>
                <p>We would pack proper winter clothes, lots of layers, and insulated boots if visiting from October to April. During the rest of the year, temperatures might vary, but there is a better chance to enjoy warm days and sunshine.</p>
                <p>Having experienced a snowstorm in July, we would always take warm clothes with us although visiting during the summer season, and you should also check the weather forecast regularly.</p>
                <p>Another thing you must consider when it comes to packing is the way you're going to travel.</p>
                <p>If you travel by car, eat in restaurants, and sleep in hotels, you do not need much.</p>
                <h6>Camping</h6>
                <p>But if you plan on staying at campgrounds, you need a reliable lightweight tent, sleeping bag, and sleeping mat.</p>
                <p>Having a proper headlamp is essential for camping, as cooking or setting up a tent in the dark with your phone is no fun at all.</p>
                <p>It is possible to rent everything and campervans usually have cooking sets included, but that's something you surely should not forget.</p>
                <h6>Hiking</h6>
                <p>Hiking boots, windbreaker, rain jacket, fleece jacket, down jacket, hiking pants, and rain poncho should go without saying.</p>
                <p>If there is one thing you should not leave without, it is certainly bear spray, which is essential, especially during the berry season. During this time, bears are active, have cubs, and bear spray is essential for hikers to stay safe.</p>
                <p>Some hikes are pretty hard, so you might want to consider using trekking poles to help with your stability and prevent knee pain.</p>
                <p>In order to lower your plastic footprint, try to avoid using single-use plastic bottles.</p>
                <p>Having a reusable water bottle when hiking is a must, as you can often fill it up from a stream along the trail. If you are concerned about water safety, use water bottle with a filter.</p>

        <div class="header" id="taxes">
            <h2>Taxes</h2>
            <div class="cat">
                <p>Alberta is the only province in Canada without a provincial sales tax (PST). The Government of Canada charges five per cent goods and services tax (GST) on most purchases.</p>
            </div>

        <div class="header" id="insurance">
            <h2>Travel Insurance</h2>
            <div class="cat">
                <p>We never leave our home without travel insurance which is designed to help cover your expenses if something goes wrong on your trip.</p>
                <p>World Nomads Travel Insurance has been designed by travelers for travelers, to cover your trip essentials.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="header" id="roads">
            <h2>Roads</h2>
            <div class="cat">
                <p>Roads through National Parks in the Canadian Rockies are paved. Main roads are open year round unless big snow storm or avalanche hits the area. It can take 2-3 days to reopen main roads. Although roads leading to some places are open only during summer months.</p>
                <p>As an example, you can drive to Moraine Lake or Takakkaw Falls only from June to the beginning of October. In addition, in summer months some roads can be under construction and closed for public use. See Parks Canada road closures information.</p>
                <p>However, many roads leading through provincial parks are not paved. Gravel surface is maintained from time to time and to have a comfortable ride you shouldn’t drive faster than 50 km/h. Many gravel roads are plowed in winter as well. Places that are worth a visit and are accessible by dirt road are Lussier Hot Springs in British Columbia, Spray Lakes in Kananaskis or Snake Indian Falls in Jasper National Park.</p>

        <div class="header" id="wildlife">
            <h2>Wildlife</h2>
            <div class="cat">
                <p>One of the most important things to know about the Canadian Rockies is that it is home to a wide array of wildlife including birds, small critters like squirrels and marmots, and large mammals like elk, moose and bears. If you see a bear, Do not approach it. Bears are wild animals - not cuddly teddies! Please don’t try to get a selfie with it - save the snapchats for something less dangerous. If you come across a bear, back away slowly and calmly, while talking gently so the bear isn’t alarmed or provoked. It is recommended that you hike in groups of 3, make noise and carry bear spray if hiking in bear territory.</p>
                <p>Similarly, don’t get too close to an elk. You’ll see a lot of them around town, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that they’re tame. As someone who recently watched a tourist get chased down the street by an elk, I strongly advise against trying to pat one.</p>
                <p>Do not feed the wildlife! As much as you think a squirrel might enjoy a Supreme Cheddar Dorito, you’re actually harming the wildlife more by feeding them. There’s a saying that “a fed bear is a dead bear”, meaning that when animals learn to associate humans with food, they begin approaching human residencies and have to be euthanised. For smaller animals like rodents, it also means that they lose the skill to forage and store food as they begin to rely on human input and they end up starving. The maximum fine for feeding wildlife is $25,000.</p>
