			<h2>Getting Around the Columbia Icefields</h2>
			<div class="cat">
				<h3>Driving</h3>
				<p>Road tripping in the Canadian Rockies is one of the top activities every traveler has on the bucket list. And there's probably not a more renowned road in the region than Columbia Icefields Parkway. We are not even afraid to say that Columbia Icefields Parkway could be a synonym for a perfect road trip anywhere in the world.</p>

			<h2>Getting Around Hinton</h2>
			<div class="cat">
				<h3>Hinton Public Transit</h3>

				<h3>Taxi</h3>
				<p>Hinton has several Taxi providers that can get you to your destination.</p>

			<h2>Getting Around Jasper</h2>
			<div class="cat">
				<h3>Driving</h3>
				<p>Visitors can rent cars in downtown Jasper, or from Edmonton International Airport or Calgary International Airport. Speed limits in the park are restricted to 90 kph (about 55 mph) on major roads and 60 kph (about 37 mph) on secondary roads. Snow tires or chains are legally required for travel on all roads, except Highway 1 and Highway 16, between November and mid-March. While driving, keep an eye out for cyclists and wildlife, which share the park's roads as well.  Keep in mind that Icefields Parkway (Highway 93) and Yellowhead Highway (Highway 16) are the two major thoroughfares that divide the park. You do not need an international driving permit in Canada.</p>
				<h3>Taxi</h3>
				<p>Three taxi companies operate in and around downtown Jasper. Keep in mind that taxi fees add up quickly though, and waits can be long if you're calling from a remote area in the park. </p>
				<h3>Shuttles</h3>
				<p>SunDog Tours offers a shuttle between Jasper, Hinton, Edson and Edmonton as well as a shuttle between Jasper, Banff and Calgary. Fares vary greatly based on pickup and drop-off points, but the shuttle is generally a cheaper option than renting a car. SunDog Tours also provides an assortment of hiking and photography tours for travelers, which are all about CA$70 (about $53) for adults. Meanwhile, the Brewster Express provides transportation between Banff and Jasper national parks during the summer.</p>

			<h2>Getting Around Lake Louise</h2>
			<div class="cat">
				<h3>Walking & Biking</h3>
				<p>The village area of Lake Louise is very small and easy to get around on foot. The ski hill is close enough that if need be you can walk to it from the village, but it is a bit of a trek with your ski gear. The actual lake is located up a long, steep hill approximately 4 km’s from the village. People do walk it, but it’s definitely a workout.</p>
				<h3>Ski Shuttle</h3>
				<p>A daily ski shuttle bus operates between Lake Louise hotels and Banff hotels and the ski resort during the winter skiing season. It also runs between Calgary, Canmore and the Lake Louise ski resort on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. More information here: Lake Louise Ski Transportation.</p>
				<h3>Summer Shuttle</h3>
				<p>This complimentary shuttle takes guests Lake Louise, the Samson Mall in the village of Lake Louise and the Lake Louise Sightseeing Gondola. Additional shuttles run back and forth from the Lake Louise Park and Ride lot on Saturdays, Sundays and holiday Mondays.</p>
				<h3>Roam Public Transit</h3>
				<p>The Roam Transit offers a regional service between Banff and Lake Louise. Year round there is a bus that runs directly from Banff to the Lake Louise Village and Lake Louise and in the summer months there another option that travels along the scenic Bow Valley Parkway. It makes the same stops in Lake Louise but along the way there are additional stops at Johnston Canyon Campground, Castle Mountain Campground, Castle Junction, Baker Creek Chalets, and Protection Mountain Campground.</p>
				<h3>Taxi</h3>
				<p>An option for getting between Lake Louise village and the lake is taking a taxi. It’s not always readily available and it’s expensive. Between the Lake and the village the fare is a set price per person, not by the meter. The last noted fare was $9 to $12 per person depending on the amount of people and the destination. Mountain Park Transportation (403) 522-522-2525 or (403) 522-2700</p>

			<h2>Getting Around Waterton</h2>
			<div class="cat">
				<h3>Walking & Biking</h3>
				<p>Waterton town site is entirely walkable, but that doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll want to do everything on foot. Bicycle, mo-ped and trolley rentals are available, and each offers an entirely different and enjoyable experience around town.</p>
				<h3>Shuttles</h3>
				<p>A lot of people are not aware that there is a hiker's shuttle operating during the summer season at Waterton.  It operates out of Tamarack Outdoor Outfitters in the village.  They offer daily shuttle services to Cameron Lake (the Cathew- Alderson Trail), Red Rock Canyon (the Tamarack Trail) and also to Chief Mountain Customs, where hikers can clear customs and connect to a Glacier- based shuttle which will take them to various trail heads in Glacier National Park.</p>
				<h3>Driving</h3>
				<p>If you plan to explore the extremities of the park, a car is recommended. Waterton covers 505 square kilometers (195 square miles) of extraordinary territory, and every inch is worth a look. A rented vehicle (or yours, if you choose to drive it) will take you along back roads all over the park, leading to distant trailheads, rushing creeks, and mountain meadows that have to be seen to be believed.</p>

			<h2>Getting Around Yoho</h2>
			<div class="cat">
				<h3>Walking & Biking</h3>
				<p>Field in Yoho is a small village and you can walk everywhere. Popular attractions and hikes are spread out in Yoho and you will need your own transport.</p>
				<h3>Driving</h3>
				<p>When you drive the Trans-Canada Highway and reach Field, you will see a Visitor Centre on your left side. You can pick up a map for the national park and inquire about campgrounds, trail reports and other information. If you’re driving a car or campervan, there are parking lots at each attraction and they’re free of charge.</p>
