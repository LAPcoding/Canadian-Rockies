                    <h1>Lake Louise Alpine World Cup</h1>
                    <p>The Lake Louise Alpine World Cup is notorious for its epic early season snow, the proximity fans have with the athletes and the intimacy of the hamlet of Lake Louise, nestled pristinely in Banff National Park. Fans from across the globe will watch as these athletes take every risk to achieve the ultimate goal. Standing on the podium means dropping 800 vertical metres downhill at speeds up to 130 km/h on a three kilometre track in just about a minute and a half. Just as gritty is watching these athletes navigate the gates of a super-G as they do everything they can to keep their skis against the snow and carve through the ice. Fast and exciting, yes.</p>

                    <p>Because of these geological and ecological factors, Waterton holds immense wildlife diversity. For its size of just over 505 sq. kilometers, Waterton Lakes National Park holds the most wildlife diversity than any other national park in Canada. In fact, it is very rare to not see some sort of wildlife in Waterton, whether it be a mule deer, elk, big horn sheep or black bear. Out of multitude of questions and general curiosity about the diversity of wildlife in Waterton, the Waterton Wildlife Weekend was born.</p>
