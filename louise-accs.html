                    <h1>Paradise Valley Campground</h1>
                    <p>If you want a stellar hike or backpacking trip, without the crowds, in the heart of the Moraine Lake – Lake Louise area, I’d highly recommend the Lake Annette – Paradise Valley – Giant Steps trail. Many people stop at Annette Lake – 5.7 km in, but then you miss some of the dramatic scenery, along with the option to hike up to Sentinel Pass. However, it’s a 20.3 km return hike to Paradise Valley – too much for many in a day. That’s where the camping option comes in. Spend a night at the Paradise Valley Campground, something you can only book 24 hours in advance.</p>

                    <h1>Skoki Lodge</h1>
                    <p>Skoki Lodge is a National Historic Site situated in a beautiful high alpine region in Banff National Park. The 11 km (6.8 mi) trail from Lake Louise to the Skoki Valley makes Skoki Lodge an ideal destination for hikers and skiers of all levels. From Skoki Lodge one can access breathtaking mountain ridges and alpine lakes, or explore five different adjoining valleys.</p>

                    <h1>Taylor Lake Campground</h1>
                    <p>The Taylor Lake hike in Banff National Park is an enjoyable hike up the lower slopes of Mount Bell to a beautiful mountain lake. The forest along the Taylor Lake trail is quite lush, in large part due to the creek the trail follows for most of its length.

                        While we think Taylor Lake is a highly enjoyable hike near Lake Louise all year around, it is especially nice in the fall when the lake is surrounded by golden larch trees. On a clear day, the sight of a glowing turquoise Banff lake surrounded by craggy mountain peaks and golden larch trees is a breathtaking sight.</p>

                    <h1>Hidden Lake</h1>
                    <p>This is a good campground for those trying to get a late day start into the Skoki district, as it is only about 7 km from the trailhead. Hidden Lake is just over 1 km from the campground, and there are many good scramble opportunities nearby.</p>

                    <h1>Hector Lake</h1>
                    <p>Although the trail is short, hikers must ford the Bow River, making this a challenging trip. Conditions improve when the river levels drop later in the summer. The river ford is not reccomended for novice hikers or for young children. The campground offers splendid lake views and is located just meters above the lakeshore. There is a communal fire pit. Firewood must be deadfall only.</p>
