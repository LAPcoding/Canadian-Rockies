At the top, enjoy the 0.5 km boardwalk along the ridge ending at Sanson Peak. Here, you will find the Sulphur Mountain Cosmic Ray Station National Historic Site and the 1903 weather observatory. From the boardwalk, return on the same trail to the parking lot. Alternatively, take an old fire road known as the Sulphur Mountain Westside Trail (5.4 km) to Sundance Trail, ending at the Cave and Basin National Historic Site (2.6 km). Please note that if you choose to go down to the westside trail, you will need to find your own transportation back to the Sulphur Mountain trailhead.</p>

                    <p>Lake Minnewanka is big and it’s windy. Make sure you don’t venture out too far from shore, as you might have difficulty skating back. Don’t get too far away from your group. Lake Minnewanka has a large parking lot, but it will fill up fast when the lake is good for skating. As mentioned previously, only park in designated spots and obey any “no parking” signs.</p>

                    <p>
                        In 1883, three rail workers stumbled across hot water and steam flowing out of a cave on the lower slopes of what is now known as Sulphur Mountain. The hot spring was discovered to be one of nine sulphurous hot springs on the mountain’s northeast flank. In the midst of the late 19th century craze for the “water cure”, commercial operations were soon established and people flocked to Banff to “take the waters” and enjoy the soothing and reputedly healing properties of the mineral-rich springs. The Banff Upper Hot Springs are the last remaining springs open to the public for bathing. </p>

                    <h1>Cave & Basin National Historic Site</h1>
                    <p>Cave and Basin has been a special place for Indigenous peoples for over ten thousand years and continues to be so to this day. In 1883, three railway workers found the thermal springs, sparking a series of events that led to the creation of Canada’s first national park. Today, the site is a gathering place for sharing stories about conservation and the connection between people and the land in Canada’s national protected areas.</p>
