                    <p>The largest lake in Yoho National Park, Emerald Lake is as beautiful and distinctively blue-green hued as its name implies. Emerald Lake is set in a secluded location, surrounded by a number of rugged mountains, as well as a glacier of the same name. Not as well known as Lake Louise and Moraine Lake, Emerald Lake is an unexpected discovery for many visitors to the Canadian Rockies.</p>

                    <h1>Railway Avenue</h1>
                    <p>The Field Valley is home to a crag of its own, relatively obscure despite being within walking distance of town. Railway Avenue is a quartzite rockface with six bolted routes to be found, tucked alongside the railway tracks at the base of Mount Stephen. The wall can be accessed by walking 45 minutes east out of town and 100m west of the Cool Spring ice climb. These climbs are not for the faint of heart: each is rated 11a (6c) or higher.</p>

                    <h1>Takakkaw Falls</h1>
                    <p>A classic route can be found beside the gigantic Takakkaw waterfall. While relatively easy at 5.7 (4), this climb is a serious outing with its notoriously chossy rock, dangerously exposed scrambling, and complicated decent. Nonetheless, the route offers a unique and memorable experience. After a few sketchy traversing pitches you'll find yourself climbing directly beside the rumbling 200-metre-tall waterfall. The excitement continues as you complete the climb by crawling through a tunnel to access the final pitch above the waterfall's upper channel.</p>

                    <p>Climbers who favour the difficult moves and technical skills demanded by bouldering will enjoy a stop at this classic road-side location. The Cathedral Mountain boulder field hosts dozens of quartzite and limestone boulders with problems ranging from V0 to V10. The aptly-named First Stone is located across from the Spiral Tunnels Lookout between Field and Lake Louise. With a handful of boulders nestled conveniently nearby, it's an accessible spot for a quick session.</p>

                    <p>This is a great trail to go see the Laughing Falls, and folks will love how well-marked the route is. Users also recommend adding a combination with Takkakaw Falls, Lace Falls, Angel Staircase Falls and Duschesny Lake - all of which are side routes from the main out and back trail.  There is generally quite a few people exploring here, so there should be just enough traffic to let folks know where they should be going the right way. The parking lot is always busy, but most users go to Takkakaw Falls. There is only one steepish part, and users will often see wildlife like  black bear.</p>

While out on this trail, you will also make your way to the Walcott Quarry, a unique area with a large deposit of fossils dating back millions of years. Hikers should take note that this area is a UNESCO heritage site that is off limits without the presence of a guide. Tours can be arranged with the Burgess Shale Geoscience Foundation.</p>

                    <h1>Spiral Tunnels & Kicking Horse Pass</h1>
                    <p>When British Columbia joined Confederation in 1871, it was on the condition that Prime Minister John A. Macdonald would build a railway to link the province to the rest of the country. Building a railway across such a large continent was a major undertaking and one of the most serious obstacles was the Rocky Mountains. Several passes were considered for the route and despite its rugged terrain, Kicking Horse Pass was chosen because of its proximity to the US border and its shorter distance to the Pacific Coast. This choice was so significant to the history of Canada that Kicking Horse Pass was designated as a National Historic Site in 1971.</p>

                    <p>Used by generations of First Nations as a route east from the Columbia River Valley through the rugged Rocky Mountains, Howse Pass now sees fewer travelers. It served the First Nations as a route through the mountains to bison, and was a short-lived gateway for European traders to the interior of British Columbia from trading posts in the foothills of Alberta. Blocked by tribes east of the pass, the traders, led by explorer and fur trader David Thompson, found a more northerly route.</p>

                    <p>Twin Falls Tea House National Historic Site was designated in 1992. The Tea House was designated because it provides a good representation of the Rustic Design Tradition, and because it is associated with outdoor recreation in the national parks. The original single-story hut was erected in 1908 by the Canadian Pacific Railway for use as an overnight shelter for backcountry trail rides. A second story and an adjacent chalet were constructed in the 1920s and later linked to the original building. Its location near the foot of Twin Falls in the Upper Yoho Valley, approximately 8.5km from the trailhead at Takakkaw Falls, has contributed to its appeal as a heritage attraction and destination for generations of hikers exploring the Yoho backcountry.</p>
